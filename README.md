## Introduction
Diggy Diggy Down, inspired by 1984's Boulder Dash, is a game where the player attempts to collect gems while avoiding boulders. Whenever the player moves, they dig out a tile of dirt. Watch out for boulders above, because if they are not supported, they will fall and crush you.

At the bottom of the level is the exit door, it's a long way down.

There are three types of gems: Blue and red loose gems and green gems that are imbedded in the dirt. Each has a different value to add to your haul.
